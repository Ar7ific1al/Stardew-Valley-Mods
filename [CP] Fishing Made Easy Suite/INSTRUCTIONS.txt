Fishing Made Easy Suite Instructions

1. Open the config.json file with a text editor (Notepad).
2. Every setting is set to 'false' by default. To enable a setting, change 'false' to 'true'. Save the changes.
3. Load the game and the setting will take effect.

To disable a setting, change the setting you made "true" back to "false"

Be sure to save any changes you make for them to take effect!

ONLY ONE SETTING CAN BE ENABLED AT A TIME!

If you happen to enable multiple settings, SMAPI will simply disable the mod from working until it's corrected.

If there's any problem's with the config file, delete the config.json file, open the game and a new config
file will be created with all settings disabled by default.
