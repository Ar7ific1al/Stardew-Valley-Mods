||Description||
With Townies Need Food, villagers will ask for cooked meals you can make in the kitchen, and reward you with gold! Like with vanilla quests, you may also gain friendship with them on completing the quest. You'll have 5 days to complete these quests, rather than only 2 days. For the quests to show up on the bulletin board, you must know the recipe, and you must have a kitchen, either from the first house upgrade, or from one of the mods listed in the Compatibility section.


||Configuration||
Main File
The quests repeat every year, and have a random chance of being offered on their specific days. For most quests, that chance is 60%. For quests that are back to back (i.e. offered on days 5, 6, and 7), the middle one has a reduced chance (40%). The random chance is to spread the quests out a bit, and provide more longevity to the mod.

Optional Files
Completionist: quests do not repeat every year, and have the same random chance to appear as the main file (60% for most, 40% for back to back)

Sparse: quests repeat every year, and have a reduced random chance to appear (30% for most, 10% for back to back)

Sparse Completionist: quests do not repeat every year, and have the same random chance to appear as the Sparse file (30% for most, 10% for back to back)
